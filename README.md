# create-hero

For review - 12.05.23

Want to do (maybe): 
1. Have individual sections of boots and weapons elements be highlited/ have sort of visual effect that shows that e.g. power treads has been selected
a. Also to possibly have information to display on when mousing over elements. (could clean up the page and create opportunities for styling/layout.

2. Align the radio buttons with the menu text: the buttons are slightly above the actual text

3. The design / layout needs to be figured out / polished 

4. Would like to add an option allowing users to delete a hero they've submitted - so that they don't have to lose every hero if they want to rework their team

5. Wasn't entireley how to go about changing redifining the mana/totalMana stuff as well
