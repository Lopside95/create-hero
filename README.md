*The app is, at the moment, only designed for use/viewing on laptop/desktop screens

This project allows users to create a hero through form selections and text inputs. Options synergise differently and final values, such as health and damage, are calculated with a number of variables in mind. Heroes can then be saved in team state and users can add other heroes to the team.
